## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or another Ethereum wallet
- Sepolia testnet ETH for transactions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
cd ui
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Copy the environment file and configure it:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Get a WalletConnect Project ID from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/)

5. Add your WalletConnect Project ID to `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
```

6. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Configuration

The interface is pre-configured for Sepolia testnet with the following contracts:

- **WSTON Proxy**: `0x4e1e3e6De6F9aE2C0D8a21626082Ef70dBa87e6D`
- **WTON Token**: `0x79e0d92670106c85e9067b56b8f674340dca0bbd`  
- **TON Token**: `0xa30fe40285b8f5c0457dbc3b7c8a280373c40044`

## Usage

### Connecting Your Wallet

1. Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right
2. Choose your preferred wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
3. Make sure you're connected to Sepolia testnet

### Depositing Tokens

1. Choose between TON or WTON in the deposit form
2. Enter the amount you want to deposit
3. Click "Approve" if needed, then "Deposit"
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

## Smart Contract Integration

The interface interacts with:

- **L1WrappedStakedTON**: Main WSTON contract for deposits/withdrawals
- **ERC20 Tokens**: TON and WTON for approvals and balance checks
- **Sepolia Network**: Ethereum testnet for safe testing

## Key Functions

- Never use real funds on testnet contracts
- Always verify contract addresses before interacting
- Test thoroughly before any mainnet deployment
- Be aware of withdrawal delay periods

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Ensure you're on Sepolia testnet
